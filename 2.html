<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
<h4>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,<br>
 including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt <br>
 the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,<br>
  small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used<br>
   with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes <br>
   it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor <br>
   pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of <br>
   structure (or: content) from presentation.</h4>
